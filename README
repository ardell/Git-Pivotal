Git-Pivotal

A git subcommand used to query Pivotal Tracker.  So you don't have to have a Pivotal window open all day.

Usage:
[]:> git pivotal list
=== Iteration: current (1 of 1)===
[1234567] Some task that I'm currently working on                 started

=== Iteration: backlog (2 of 12)===
[1234568] Foo bar #1                                            unstarted
[1234569] Foo bar #2                                            unstarted

[]:> git pivotal list current
=== Iteration: current (1 of 1)===
